<h3>Abstract</h3>

How do protein structure prediction models fold proteins? We investigate this question by tracing how ESMFold folds a beta hairpin, a prevalent structural motif. Through counterfactual interventions on model latents, we identify two computational stages in the folding trunk. In the first stage, early blocks initialize <em>pairwise biochemical signals</em>: residue identities and associated biochemical features like charge flow from sequence representations into pairwise representations. In the second stage, late blocks develop <em>pairwise spatial features</em>: distance and contact information accumulate in the pairwise representation. We demonstrate that the mechanisms underlying structural decisions of ESMFold can be localized, traced through interpretable representations, and manipulated with strong causal effects.

<h2>Introduction</h2>

<p>
How do protein folding models fold proteins? We study these questions in ESMFold. Like AlphaFold2, OpenFold, and Boltz-2, ESMFold is built around a <em>folding trunk</em>, the architectural component in which sequence becomes structure. The trunk iteratively refines a sequence representation while building a pairwise representation that encodes relationships between residues; a structure module then decodes these into 3D coordinates. Mechanistically understanding these learned computations could inform how we interact with, diagnose, and build on this entire class of models.
</p>

<p>
In this work, we conduct the first mechanistic analysis of a protein model folding trunk and focus on how it folds a simple and prevalent structural motif: the beta hairpin. We use activation patching to transplant sequence and pairwise representations from a donor protein containing a beta hairpin into a target protein containing an alpha-helical region. By observing whether the patched trunk produces a hairpin in the target region, we find that ESMFold folds a hairpin in two computational stages.
</p>

<p>
In the first stage, early blocks initialize pairwise biochemical signals: residue identities and associated biochemical features like charge flow from sequence representations into pairwise representations. In the second stage, late blocks develop pairwise spatial features: distance and contact information accumulate in the pairwise representation.

<h2>Background</h2>

<h3>Protein Structure</h3>

  <figure class="center_image" style="margin-top: 30px">
  <center><img src="images/paper/betaHairpin.jpg" style="width:100%; max-width:400px"></center>
  <figcaption><strong>Beta-hairpin structure.</strong> A simple protein motif consisting of two antiparallel beta strands connected by a tight turn. Backbone atoms are shown with hydrogen bonds (dashed lines) stabilizing the sheet structure, and C$_\alpha$–C$_\alpha$ distances are commonly used to measure inter-residue distances.</figcaption>
  </figure>

<p>
<strong>Chains of amino acids.</strong> Proteins are linear polymers of amino acids, each with a central carbon (C$_\alpha$) bonded to a backbone (N-C-C) and a variable sidechain. The sequence of amino acids defines the protein's primary structure.
</p>

<p>
<strong>Secondary structure.</strong> Local regions of the backbone adopt regular conformations stabilized by hydrogen bonds. The two most common secondary structures are alpha-helices (spiral structures) and beta-sheets (extended strands). A beta-hairpin consists of two adjacent antiparallel beta strands connected by a tight turn.
</p>

<h3>Protein Structure Prediction with ESMFold</h3>

<p>
ESMFold <a href="#ref-lin2023" class="citation-link">[Lin et al., 2023]</a> predicts protein structure from sequence alone using a two-stage architecture:
</p>

  <figure class="center_image" style="margin-top: 30px">
  <center><img src="images/paper/esmfold_architecture.png" style="width:100%; max-width:800px"></center>
  <figcaption><strong>Figure 1: ESMFold Architecture.</strong> The model consists of (1) ESM-2 language model that embeds the sequence, (2) Folding Trunk that processes sequence and pairwise representations through multiple blocks, and (3) Structure Module that converts pairwise features into 3D coordinates.</figcaption>
  </figure>

<p>
<strong>Module 1: ESM-2 Language Model.</strong> The input sequence is first processed by ESM-2, a 3B-parameter transformer pretrained on 250M protein sequences. ESM-2 produces a contextualized embedding $s_i \in \mathbb{R}^{2560}$ for each residue position $i$, capturing evolutionary and structural patterns learned during pretraining.
</p>

<p>
<strong>Module 2: Folding Trunk.</strong> The core of ESMFold is a folding trunk consisting of 48 stacked blocks. Each block maintains two representations:
</p>

<ul>
<li>Sequence representation $s_i$ (per-residue features)</li>
<li>Pairwise representation $z_{ij}$ (features for each residue pair)</li>
</ul>



<p>
Each folding block performs the following operations:
</p>

  <figure class="center_image" style="margin-top: 30px">
  <center><img src="images/paper/esmfold_foldingtrunk.png" style="width:100%; max-width:700px"></center>
  <figcaption><strong>Folding trunk detail.</strong> The trunk consists of 48 repeating blocks, each processing both sequence and pairwise representations.</figcaption>
  </figure>

<p>
<strong>Sequence-to-Pair (Seq2Pair):</strong> Projects sequence features into pairwise space:
</p>

$$z_{ij} \leftarrow z_{ij} + W_{\text{out}} \cdot \text{ReLU}(W_i s_i + W_j s_j + b)$$

<p>
</p>

<p>
<strong>Pair2Seq:</strong> Aggregates pairwise features back to sequence space:
</p>

$$s_i \leftarrow s_i + W_{\text{out}} \sum_j \alpha_{ij} V_{ij}$$

<p>
where $\alpha_{ij}$ are attention weights and $V_{ij} = W_V z_{ij}$.
</p>

<p>
<strong>Triangle updates and attention:</strong> The pairwise representation is updated using triangle multiplicative updates (inspired by AlphaFold2) and row/column attention to propagate constraints across the 2D grid.
</p>

<p>
<strong>Stage 3: Structure Module.</strong> After 48 folding blocks, the final pairwise representation $z_{ij}$ is passed to a structure module that predicts 3D coordinates.
</p>

<h2>When Does the Model Fold a Hairpin?</h2>

<p>
We use activation patching to localize where hairpin formation is computed in the folding trunk. We select a <strong>donor protein</strong> containing a beta hairpin and a <strong>target protein</strong> containing a helix-turn-helix motif. We run both proteins through ESMFold, extracting the sequence representation $s$ and pairwise representation $z$ at each block of the folding trunk. During the target's forward pass, we replace representations in the target's helical region with the donor's hairpin representations, aligning the two regions at their loop positions. We then observe whether the output structure contains a hairpin in the patched region.
</p>

    <figure class="center_image" style="margin-top: 30px">
  <center><img src="images/paper/FigureCActivationPatchingDraft4.png" style="width:100%; max-width:800px"></center>
  <figcaption><strong>Figure 3: Activation Patching Setup.</strong> We run a donor protein containing a beta hairpin through ESMFold and extract the sequence (orange) and pairwise (green) representations of the hairpin region. During the forward pass of a target protein containing a helix-turn-helix motif, we replace the target's representations with the donor's hairpin representations at a single block, then measure if the output contains a hairpin.</figcaption>
  </figure>

<p>
<strong>Dataset construction.</strong> We curated a dataset of 106 target proteins consisting of alpha-helical structures from diverse protein families. For donor hairpins, we assembled a dataset of about 80,000 beta hairpins extracted from the Protein Data Bank. Each hairpin consists of two strands (5–10 residues each) connected by a short loop (2–5 residues). We identified internal loop regions in each target protein, then sampled 10 donor hairpins per loop, yielding about 5,000 patching experiments in total.
</p>

<p>
<strong>Full patching establishes feasibility.</strong> We first verify that patching can induce hairpin formation by patching both sequence and pairwise representations across all 48 blocks of the folding trunk. Approximately 40% of patches (~2,000 cases) successfully produce a hairpin in the target region, as measured by DSSP secondary structure assignment.
</p>

<p>
<strong>Single-block patching reveals two regimes.</strong> To localize the computation, we patch at a single block $k$, patching either sequence or pairwise representations alone. Restricting to the ~2,000 cases where full patching succeeded, we measure the success rate for each block and representation type:
</p>

<ul>
<li><span class="stage-early"><strong>Sequence patches</strong> are effective in early blocks (0–7), with success rates peaking around 40% at block 0 and declining thereafter.</span></li>
<li><span class="stage-late"><strong>Pairwise patches</strong> show the opposite pattern: they only become effective starting around block 25, reaching success rates around 20% by block 35.</span></li>
</ul>

<p>
This reveals two distinct computational stages: <span class="stage-early">early blocks where sequence information drives hairpin formation</span>, and <span class="stage-late">late blocks where pairwise representations take over</span>.
</p>

<h2>Early Blocks: Building Pairwise Chemistry</h2>

<h3>Sequence Information Flows Into Pairwise Space</h3>

<p>
Why does sequence patching only work in early blocks? We hypothesize that early blocks serve the critical role of transferring information from $s$ into $z$ via the <strong>seq2pair</strong> pathway, populating $z$ before downstream computations begin.
</p>

  <figure class="center_image" style="margin-top: 30px">
  <center><img src="images/paper/Figure2.png" style="width:100%; max-width:800px"></center>
  <figcaption><strong>Figure 4: Information Flow Analysis.</strong> (a) Shift in representations under different interventions. Sequence patching at block 0 leads to pairwise representation alignment with the donor. Freezing seq2pair prevents this alignment. (b) Ablating seq2pair in early blocks dramatically reduces hairpin formation during sequence patching.</figcaption>
  </figure>

<p>
<strong>Representation similarity.</strong> After patching sequence at block 0, we track how the pairwise representation changes across blocks. We find that $z$ rapidly becomes donor-like in the first ~10 blocks, then changes only gradually afterward. This suggests a short early "write-in" window during which sequence-level information is transferred into $z$.
</p>

<p>
<strong>Pathway ablations.</strong> We confirm that seq2pair is necessary for hairpin formation by performing sliding-window ablations. <span class="stage-early">Ablating seq2pair in blocks 0–20 dramatically reduces hairpin formation; ablating it in later blocks has little effect.</span> This confirms that sequence patches work because they propagate into $z$ via seq2pair during early blocks.
</p>

<h3>Which Sequence Features are Propagated?</h3>

<p>
To identify which specific sequence features are transferred to pairwise space, we use <strong>linear probing</strong> and <strong>causal interventions</strong>.
</p>
  
  <figure class="center_image" style="margin-top: 30px">
  <center><img src="images/paper/Figure6ChargeBoomDraft4.png" style="width:100%; max-width:800px"></center>
  <figcaption><strong>Figure 5: Charge Direction Mechanism.</strong> <span class="stage-early">Early blocks propagate charge information from sequence to pairwise representations.</span> We show that intervening on charge-related features in $s_i$ causes predictable changes in $z_{ij}$ patterns, particularly for residue pairs with opposite charges.</figcaption>
  </figure>

<p>
<strong>Charge direction.</strong> Beta-hairpins are often stabilized by electrostatic interactions between charged residues on opposite strands. We probe whether early blocks encode this.
</p>

<p>
For each residue $i$, we compute its charge $q_i \in \{-1, 0, +1\}$ (negative for Asp/Glu, positive for Lys/Arg, neutral otherwise). We then train a linear probe to predict the product $q_i \cdot q_j$ from the pairwise representation $z_{ij}$.
</p>

<p>
<strong>Result:</strong> <span class="stage-early">The probe achieves 85% accuracy at block 12, indicating that early blocks explicitly represent charge complementarity in $z_{ij}$.</span>
</p>

<p>
<strong>Steering experiment.</strong> To verify this causally, we identify the direction in $z_{ij}$ space corresponding to "opposite charges attract." We then intervene by adding this direction to $z_{ij}$ for pairs with same charge:
</p>

$$z_{ij}^{\text{steered}} = z_{ij} + \lambda \cdot \vec{d}_{\text{charge}}$$

<p>
<strong>Result:</strong> Steering causes the model to predict structures with artificial salt bridges between same-charge residues, confirming that <span class="stage-early">early $z_{ij}$ encodes charge interactions that influence downstream geometry</span>.
</p>

<h2>Late Blocks: Pairwise Geometry Emerges</h2>

<h3>Pairwise Representation Encodes Distance</h3>

<p>
By the late blocks, sequence patching no longer induces hairpin formation, but pairwise patching does. This suggests that the pairwise representation $z$ has taken over as the primary carrier of folding-relevant information. We hypothesize that $z$ encodes spatial relationships—particularly pairwise distances.
</p>

 <figure class="center_image" style="margin-top: 30px">
  <center><img src="images/paper/Figure7ContactSteeringDraft12.png" style="width:100%; max-width:800px"></center>
  <figcaption><strong>Figure 6: Distance Encoding and Steering.</strong> (a) $R^2$ score of linear distance probes reaches ~0.9 at late blocks. (b) Hydrogen bond formation peaks when steering blocks 20–35. (c) Steering setup: we steer cross-strand residue pairs toward a target distance of 5.5Å.</figcaption>
  </figure>

<p>
<strong>Distance probing.</strong> We train linear probes to predict pairwise C$_\alpha$ distance from $z$ at each block. Even at block 0, $z$ contains some distance information from positional embeddings. But as $z$ is populated with sequence information and refined through triangular updates, <span class="stage-late">probe accuracy increases substantially, reaching $R^2 \approx 0.9$ by late blocks</span>.
</p>

<p>
<strong>Distance steering.</strong> Since the probe is linear, we can steer toward a target distance (5.5Å, the typical C$_\alpha$–C$_\alpha$ spacing for cross-strand contacts in beta-sheets) by moving along the probe's weight direction:
</p>

$$z'_{ij} = z_{ij} - \alpha \cdot \mathbf{w}$$

<p>
<strong>Result:</strong> <span class="stage-late">Steering in blocks 20–35 is most effective, with hydrogen bond formation peaking around 40%.</span> Steering in early blocks is less effective both because probes are less accurate and because subsequent computation can overwrite the perturbation. This confirms that late $z$ causally determines geometric outputs.
</p>

<h3>Pair2Seq Promotes Contact Information</h3>

<p>
How does distance information in $z$ influence the rest of the computation? The pair2seq pathway projects $z$ to produce a scalar bias that modulates sequence self-attention.
</p>

 <figure class="center_image" style="margin-top: 30px">
  <center><img src="images/paper/Figure4Pair2seqDraft3.png" style="width:100%; max-width:800px"></center>
  <figcaption><strong>Figure 7: Pair2Seq Bias and Patching Effects.</strong> (a) After patching $z$, attention shifts toward donor contacts and away from target contacts. (b) Ablating the pair2seq bias after patching results in minor drops in hairpin formation.</figcaption>
  </figure>

<p>
<strong>Bias encodes contacts.</strong> In middle and late blocks, the pair2seq bias cleanly separates contacting residue pairs (C$_\alpha$ distance < 8Å) from non-contacts. <span class="stage-late">Residue pairs in contact receive substantially more positive bias than non-contacts</span>, encouraging the sequence attention to preferentially mix information between contacting residues.
</p>

<p>
<strong>Causal role.</strong> We tested this by patching the pairwise representation at block 27 and measuring how sequence attention changes. <span class="stage-late">After patching, attention to donor-unique contacts increases substantially (up to 400%), while attention to target-unique contacts decreases.</span> The pairwise representation causally redirects which residues attend to each other.
</p>

<h3>The Structure Module Uses Z as a Distance Map</h3>

<p>
The pair2seq pathway is one route by which $z$ influences the output. But $z$ also feeds directly into the structure module, which produces the final 3D coordinates.
</p>

  <figure class="center_image" style="margin-top: 30px">
  <center><img src="images/paper/Figure5StructureModuleScalingDraft12.png" style="width:100%; max-width:700px"></center>
  <figcaption><strong>Figure 8: Structure Module Scaling Experiment.</strong> (a) Effect of scaling $z$ versus $s$ on mean pairwise C$_\alpha$ distance. Scaling $z$ monotonically scales the output structure; scaling $s$ has virtually no effect. (b) Example structures at different pairwise scaling factors.</figcaption>
  </figure>

<p>
<strong>Scaling experiment.</strong> We scaled the pairwise representation by factors ranging from 0 to 2 before it enters the structure module, while holding $s$ fixed. We then repeated the experiment scaling $s$ while holding $z$ fixed.
</p>

<p>
<strong>Result:</strong> <span class="stage-late">Scaling $z$ monotonically scales the mean pairwise distance between residues in the output structure.</span> Scaling up causes the protein to expand; scaling down causes it to contract. In contrast, scaling $s$ has virtually no effect on output geometry. Together with our steering experiments, this confirms that $z$ acts as a geometric blueprint that the structure module renders into 3D coordinates.
</p>

<p>
<strong>Interpretability of AI protein folders.</strong> Most work on interpreting AlphaFold2 and ESMFold has focused on attention visualizations <a href="#ref-jumper2021" class="citation-link">[Jumper et al., 2021]</a> or probing embeddings for secondary structure <a href="#ref-vig2020" class="citation-link">[Vig et al., 2020]</a>. Our work is the first to apply causal interventions (activation patching, steering) to trace mechanistic information flow through the model.
</p>

<p>
<strong>Mechanistic interpretability.</strong> Activation patching was introduced for language models <a href="#ref-meng2022" class="citation-link">[Meng et al., 2022]</a> and has been used to reverse-engineer circuits for factual recall and algorithmic reasoning <a href="#ref-wang2022" class="citation-link">[Wang et al., 2022]</a>. We adapt these techniques to a scientific domain where ground truth (protein physics) provides strong priors for what features we expect.
</p>

<p>
<strong>Beta-hairpin folding.</strong> Beta-hairpins have been extensively studied experimentally <a href="#ref-munoz1997" class="citation-link">[Muñoz et al., 1997]</a> and computationally <a href="#ref-dill2008" class="citation-link">[Dill et al., 2008]</a>. The biophysical principles—charge complementarity, turn propensity, hydrophobic collapse—are well understood, making hairpins an ideal test case for interpretability.
</p>

<h2>Discussion</h2>

<p>
Our analysis reveals that ESMFold implements an interpretable, multi-stage algorithm for protein folding. Rather than learning opaque statistical patterns, the model discovers structured representations that align with physical chemistry:
</p>

<ul>
<li><span class="stage-early">Early blocks extract biochemical features (charge, hydrophobicity) from the sequence and propagate them into pairwise space via Seq2Pair.</span></li>
<li><span class="stage-late">Late blocks encode geometric constraints (distances, contacts) in the pairwise representation, using Pair2Seq to create feedback loops that reinforce consistent structural hypotheses.</span></li>
<li>The structure module interprets the final pairwise representation as a learned distance map, translating it into 3D coordinates.</li>
</ul>

<p>
These findings have implications for AI safety and scientific understanding. They suggest that modern neural networks, when trained on data with rich physical structure, can learn interpretable algorithms rather than brittle heuristics. This is encouraging for applying AI to scientific problems where we care about understanding mechanisms, not just achieving high accuracy.
</p>

<p>
<strong>Future work.</strong> Our analysis focused on a simple motif (beta-hairpin); extending this to more complex folds (alpha-helices, tertiary contacts) will reveal whether the same principles apply. Additionally, comparing ESMFold's representations to those of AlphaFold2 could identify which architectural choices lead to interpretability.
</p>

<h3>Limitations</h3>

<p>
<strong>Simplified test case.</strong> Beta-hairpins are among the simplest protein structures. More complex folds may involve additional mechanisms not visible in our analysis.
</p>

<p>
<strong>Causality vs. correlation.</strong> While activation patching and steering provide causal evidence, they do not fully rule out confounding factors or distributed representations that serve multiple roles.
</p>

<p>
<strong>Generalization.</strong> We analyzed ESMFold on a specific family of sequences. The mechanisms we identified may not generalize to all protein types or to other folding models.
